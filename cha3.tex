\section{Electrical structure}\label{sec:elec_struct}
\begin{itemize}
\item Describe electrical layout and how everything is connected
\item Improvement:
 \begin{itemize}
  \item Battery voltage watcher->preferably beeping
  \item better connections and connectors for connecting new sensors and components
  \item 3d printed base with considerations for a battery holder and one switch to power off
  \item servos reacting because of self interference in wiring
 \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\section{SBC}\label{sec:sbc_lim}
\begin{itemize}
 \item compare Raspi to other SBCs
 \item compare to jetson nano, cuda toolkit
 \item RAM limitations->cross compile during development
 \item Ethernet and Wifi limitations
 \item storage durability->no onboard flash
 \item overheating when compiling
 \item USB power limitation
\end{itemize}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\section{Software}\label{software_lim}
\begin{itemize}
 \item compare ROS1 and ROS2
 \item driver availability for the raspberry and ROS support
 \item Raspbian vs Ubuntu 16.04 for the raspberry and the ubiquity ROS image
\end{itemize}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\section{IMU}\label{imu_lim}
\begin{itemize}
 \item Describe the drawbacks of the IMU and the drifting issue in general
\end{itemize}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\section{Motors}\label{motor_lim}
\begin{itemize}
 \item no feedback mechanism->rotary encoder
 \item cant go forward and turn at the same time
 \item generally loud
\end{itemize}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\section{Similar platforms}\label{sec:similar_platforms}
\begin{itemize}
 \item Find similar platforms and compare uses and price
\end{itemize}
