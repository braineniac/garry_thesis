\chapter{Acknowledgements}\label{cha:acknowledgements}

I would like to thank my supervisors Simon Schreiberhuber and Jean-Baptiste Weibel for guiding and helping me through writing this thesis, and fostering my intrinsic motivation for robotics and control theory.

I would also like to thank the subreddit r/ControlTheory for helping me identify errors in my initial model on the weekend and for building a community supportive of people with all levels of skill.

My biggest thank you goes to my parents, who supported me during all these years of studying and were always there for me when I needed them no matter what.

Lastly I would like to thank my friends Jenny, Alex, Andi, Elli, Aoife, Meli and Stefan for their support during my studies and writing this thesis.
