\chapter{Outlook}\label{cha:outlook}

For more accurate turns the platform could be equipped with a wheel encoder  coupled with a more accurate rotation model. The gyroscope could also be corrected with a magnetometer.

The underlying electrical structure could be improved by designing a custom Arduino Shield for reliability and monitoring. Additional voltage rails would make installing new modules a breeze.

The platform could be also equipped with a wealth of environment sensors similar to the Wolfbot mentioned in Section \ref{sec:wolfbot}.Replacing the wheels with omnidirectional ones would also give it better maneuverability.

The platform is not as well suited for more demanding visual SLAM methods using the available cameras like the Jetbot mentioned in Section \ref{sec:jetbot} or the newly released Raspberry Pi 4 due to better access to the GPU. The Raspberry Pi 4 would be an easy upgrade and would enable support for OpenGL ES 3\footnotemark.
