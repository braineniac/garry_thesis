\chapter{Conclusion}\label{cha:conclusion}

In the thesis we introduced a platform built out of remains of a toy robot and equipped it with components that make it a cost effective solution for research.

We implemented a system using custom Kalman filters for odometry using joystick signals as a control input and IMU sensors as an output.

Due to the accelerometer's lower than 1 signal-to-noise ratio(SNR) we suppressed its impact on the state estimation with a higher process noise covariance $\textbf{Q}_k$. The noise originated from the DC motor's vibrations.

From the conducted experiments we have learned that small errors in the rotation accumulate easily and cause deformation of the overall trajectory.

Improving the odometry with visual SLAM like ORB-SLAM2\cite{mur2017orb} is not computationally feasible on the Raspberry Pi 3 without further code optimizations.
