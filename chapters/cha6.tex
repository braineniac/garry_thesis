The accelerometer's drift could be accounted for in a loop closing method if the path is relatively short or manually accounting of the sensor by staying still. Another option would be to fine tune the $\textbf{r}_k$ ratio and use the robot\_localization package, but it would require very time consuming tests and an accurate distance measuring sensor.

The platform is well suited for not very demanding visual SLAM methods using the available cameras, but for such research the Jetbot mentioned in Section \ref{sec:jetbot} is better suited for it. An upgrade to the newly released Raspberry Pi 4 would be well justified, because of greatly updated specifications, especially GPU, and support for OpenGL ES 3\footnotemark.
