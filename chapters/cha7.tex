\chapter{Outlook}\label{cha:outlook}

The SNR on the accelerometer could be raised by dampening the DC motor's vibrations or replacing them entirely. A higher frequency accelerometer would also make the robot's acceleration phase more apparent in the acquired sensor data.

For more accurate turns the platform could be equipped with a wheel encoder  coupled and corrected with a magnetometer. Refining the rotation model would also yield an improvement in accuracy.

The electrical structure could be improved by designing a custom Arduino Shield for reliability and monitoring. Additional voltage rails would make installing new modules a breeze.

The robot could be also equipped with a wealth of environment sensors similar to the Wolfbot mentioned in Section \ref{sec:wolfbot}. Replacing the wheels with omnidirectional ones would also give it better maneuverability.

Developing and optimizing visual SLAM methods would be better on the newly released Raspberry Pi 4 due to OpenGL ES 3\footnotemark support or the Jetson Nano on the the Jetbot mentioned in Section \ref{sec:jetbot} due to the SDKs.
