\chapter{Experiments}

In this section we show the experiments with the platform and how we set the parameters described in Section \ref{sec:kalman} and our Kalman Filter accuracy.

After choosing a parameter during the \ref{sec:parameterfitting} we run the some experiments with our Extended Kalman Filter to see how switching the Kalman Filter effects the states with the same parameters.

All of the experiments were performed by recording the sensor data on the robot while performing the experiment. Then we transformed the sensor data to the same reference point and ran the Kalman Filters offline. This process was automated to ensure paramater consistency during each run, but could also be easily run online on the robot.
