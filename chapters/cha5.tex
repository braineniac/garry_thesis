\chapter{Conclusion}\label{cha:conclusion}

In this thesis we introduced a platform built out of remains of a toy robot and equipped it with components that make it a cost effective solution for research.
From the experiments we conducted in Chapter \ref{cha:exp} we can conclude that odometry based on our fake wheel encoder is not well refined by our accelerometer due to drifts caused by low in run bias stability. Such issues do not plague the gyroscope in our IMU and can be used with our fake wheel encoder for relatively accurate odometry as seen in Section.TODO
