\chapter{Experiments}

In this section we show the experiments with the platform and how we set the parameters described in section \ref{cha:customkalman} and our Kalman filter accuracy.

After choosing the parameters during the \ref{sec:paramfitting} we run the same experiments with the adaptive process noise feature to see how it effects the states with the same parameters.

All of the experiments were performed by recording the sensor data on the robot while performing the experiment. Then we transformed the sensor data to the same reference point and ran the Kalman filters offline. This process was automated to ensure parameter consistency during each run, but could also be easily run online on the robot.
