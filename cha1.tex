\chapter{Platform architecture}\label{cha:PlatformArchitecture}

\begin{itemize}
 \item Describe the purpose of the platform->reference abstract?
 \item Describe platform in general parts terms(wheeled robot with imu, linux based SBC, microcontroller etc.)
\end{itemize}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\section{Hardware}
\pagestyle{scrheadings}

\begin{itemize}
 \item Explain the hardware choices and what we had to work with and what we chose to work with
 \item add pictures
\end{itemize}

This is just here so I remember the exact names, I would describe the part choices and use in separate paragraphs.
\begin{itemize}
 \item Raspberry Pi 3 Model B Rev 1.2
 \item Arduino Uno Rev3
 \item Arduino Motor Shield Rev3
 \item Raspberry Pi Night Vision Camera Module
 \item Logitech C905 Webcam
 \item SparkFun 9DoF Razor IMU M0
 \item Logitech Dual Action Gamepad
 \item 2x generic 5V DC motors
 \item 2x EMAX ES08MA II 12g Mini Metal Gear Analog Servo
\end{itemize}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\section{Software}
\pagestyle{scrheadings}

\begin{itemize}
 \item Describe the software stack: Linux+ROS+Arduino
 \item Why using linux+ROS makes sense instead of hardcoding everything, highlight ROS pros and contras
 \item Arduino platform and software uses here and in general-> comparison to full real time systems and microROS projects and how the comm bridge to ROS is implemented
\end{itemize}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\section{Expandability}
\pagestyle{scrheadings}

\begin{itemize}
 \item Describe the possible expansions of the platform for different applications
 \item Application ideas: 
 \begin{itemize}
 \item odometry based on vision->maybe moving the camera with the servos
 \item adding a distance measuring sensor and use it for mapping(lidar or ultrasonic)
 \item mapping pointclouds with the camera
 \item use both cameras for 360 degree simultaneous mapping
 \item other ideas?
 \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}
