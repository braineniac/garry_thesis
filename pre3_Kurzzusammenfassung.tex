\addchap*{Short summary}
The availability and low cost of maker products enable wide adoption and make it possible for most hobbyists and 
researchers to build robots for their specific applications on the cheap.
For our robotic platform we chose readily available components, but kept expandability in mind. The current market 
value of these hardware components was also considered to make it more reproducible at an affordable cost. Our choice 
was dictated by what we already had available at the time of building and is not meant to be the most cost effective 
nor the best price per accuracy solution. Almost every part of the platform is meant to be easily replaceable and can 
be adapted for their intended application or area of research.
Basic odometry serves as a starting point for future projects that can expand its capabilities and improve its accuracy 
by using multiple sensors, audio feedback or video processing.
